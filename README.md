Task 1:
type ‘python block_chain_4_1.py’ to execute the code

Functions defined: 
create_account() to create a public key and a private key

run_blockchain() to record a transcation and store it in merkle tree

create_merkle_tree() to create a merkle tree to store the transcation record

Main():
create public keys and private keys for Alice and Bob

Stimulate a transaction of 100 coins from Alice to Bob

Store the transaction in a block of Merkle Tree()

Task3:
Construction of blockchain

Function defined :
create_account(): This function will create a new blockchain account, which likely involves generating a public-private key pair that can be used for secure transactions.

run_blockchain(): This function will handle the process of recording a transaction on the blockchain. It will validate the transaction, creating a transaction record, and broadcasting the transaction to the network.

create_merkle_tree(): The function will construct a Merkle tree. Merkle trees are used in blockchains to efficiently and securely verify the contents of large data structures like transaction records.

The transaction is stored in a block within a Merkle Tree using the `create_merkle_tree()` function. The Merkle Tree helps to ensure the integrity of the transaction data within the block and across the blockchain.

Task4:
Integrity verification of transactions and blockchains
